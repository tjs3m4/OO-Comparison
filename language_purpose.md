# Language Purposes
-------------------------
C#
===
Originally named "Cool" (standing for "C-like Object Oriented Language") during the development of the language, C# was created to be a general purpose object oriented language that is simple and modern. Fundamentals of the language were created in response to what the creators considered flaws in other major programming languages at the time.

The name C# comes from musical notation where a note's pitch can be increased by one semitone by adding a sharp symbol (&#9839;). The naming convention implies that C# is a step above C.
	Note that the character &#9839; does not exist on most keyboards, so # was used instead.
