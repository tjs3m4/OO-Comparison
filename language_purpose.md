# Language Purposes
-------------------------
C#
===
Originally named "Cool" (standing for "C-like Object Oriented Language") during the development of the language, C# was created to be a general purpose object oriented language that is simple and modern. Fundamentals of the language were created in response to what the creators considered flaws in other major programming languages (namely Java and C++) at the time.

The name C# comes from musical notation where a note's pitch can be increased by one semitone by adding a sharp symbol (&#9839;). The naming convention implies that C# is a step above C.
	Note that the character &#9839; does not exist on most keyboards, so # was used instead.

C++
===

C++ was initialiy concieved to be "C with classes". The creator, Bjarne Stroustrup, found that an older object oriented language called Simula had some features that were helpful for large-scale software development. However, Simula was too slow for practical use. Stroustrup wanted to introduce object oriented concepts to an existing language that was fast enough to be used in software development. He chose C as the base language because it was widely used, fast, portable, and general-purpose.

The name C++ comes from the ++ operator in C, which increments a variable by adding 1 to its value. Much like C#, this naming convention implies that C++ is a step above C.
