# Programming Paradigms
-------------------------
C#
===
C# is fundamentally an object oriented language, and any function must be implemented inside of a class. The closest thing you can get to a standalone function is to wrap the function in a static class that never gets initialized. This means that everything in C# is an object. In this way it does not support a fully procedural style of programming.  

As far as functional programming goes, C# does have some support.

C++
===
Even though it was designed to be C with classes, it would be hard to tell that by looking at it today, as it has been kept up to date with other programming languages, and things that have proven their worth in other languages have been added to C++ throughout the years. 

C++ supports the procedural style of programming that you would expect from C. In addition it allows you to program in an object oriented style by creating classes and objects. C++ uses a lot of "under the hood" tactics to make its object oriented components work, and in that way it is fundamentally different from most other object oriented languages, but the ideas, techniques, and strategies of an object oriented language are still there. 

C++ offers support for functional programming (introduced in C++11). C++ introduced lambda expressions to help make the use of many functions cleaner.
